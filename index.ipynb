    "## Organization\n",
    "The repository is organized as follows:\n",
    "- The dataset is placed in (`data/`).\n",
    "- The code open sourced from the article [\"Dynamic Slate Recommendation with Gated Recurrent Units and Thompson Sampling\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15046) is found in (`code/`). However, we are in the process of making the data more generally available which makes the code incompatible with the current (newer) version of the data. Please use [the v1.0 release of the repository](https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/tree/v1.0) for a compatible version of the code and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart dataset [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/blob/master/quickstart-finn-recsys-slate-data.ipynb)\n",
    "We provide a quickstart jupyter notebook that runs on Google Colab (quickstart-finn-recsys-slate-data.ipynb) which includes all necessary steps above.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: This quickstart notebook is currently incompatible with the main branch. \n",
    "We will update the notebook as soon as we have published a pip-package. In the meantime, please use [the v1.0 release of the repository](https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/tree/v1.0)\n",

    "### Dataset files\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset `data.npz` contains the following fields:\n",
    "- userId: The unique identifier of the user.\n",
    "- click: The items the user clicked on in each of the 20 presented slates.\n",
    "- click_idx: The index the clicked item was on in each of the 20 presented slates.\n",
    "- slate_lengths: The length of the 20 presented slates.\n",
    "- slate: All the items in each of the 20 presented slates.\n",
    "- interaction_type: The recommendation slate can be the result of a search query (1), a recommendation (2) or can be undefined (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset `itemattr.npz` contains the categories ranging from 0 to 290. Corresponding with the 290 unique groups that the items belong to. These 290 unique groups are constructed using a combination of categorical information and the geographical location. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset  `ind2val.json` contains the mapping between the indices and the values of the categories (e.g. `\"287\": \"JOB, Rogaland\"`) and interaction types (e.g. `\"1\": \"search\"`).                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

    "## Todo\n",
    "This repository is currently *work in progress*, and we will provide descriptions and tutorials. Suggestions and contributions to make the material more available is welcome.\n",
    "There are some features of the repository that we are working on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Release the dataset as numpy objects instead of pytorch arrays. This will help non-pytorch users to more easily utilize the data\n",
    "- [x] Maintain a pytorch dataset for easy usage\n",
    "- [ ] Create a pip package for easier installation and usage. the package should download the dataset using a function.\n",
    "- [ ] Make the quickstart guide compatible with the pip package and numpy format.\n",
    "- [ ] Add easily useable functions that compute relevant metrics such as hitrate, log-likelihood etc.\n",
    "- [ ] Distribute the data on other platforms such as kaggle.\n",
    "- [ ] Add a short description of the data in the readme.md directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the current state is in early stage, it makes sense to allow the above changes non-backward compatible. \n",
    "However, this should be completed within the next couple of months."
