    "## Organization\n",
    "The repository is organized as follows:\n",
    "- The dataset is placed in `data/` and stored using git-lfs. We also provide an automatic download function in the pip package (preferred usage).\n",
    "- The code open sourced from the article [\"Dynamic Slate Recommendation with Gated Recurrent Units and Thompson Sampling\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15046) is found in (`code_eide_et_al21/`). However, we are in the process of making the data more generally available which makes the code incompatible with the current (newer) version of the data. Please use [the v1.0 release of the repository](https://github.com/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/tree/v1.0) for a compatible version of the code and dataset.\n",

    "## Quickstart dataset [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/finn-no/recsys-slates-dataset/blob/main/examples/quickstart-finn-recsys-slate-data.ipynb)\n",
    "We provide a quickstart Jupyter notebook that runs on Google Colab (quickstart-finn-recsys-slate-data.ipynb) which includes all necessary steps above.\n",

    "## Example training scripts\n",
    "We provide an example training jupyter notebook that implements a matrix factorization model with categorical loss that can be found in `examples/`.\n",

    "The dataset `data.npz` contains the following fields:\n",
    "- userId: The unique identifier of the user.\n",
    "- click: The items the user clicked on in each of the 20 presented slates.\n",
    "- click_idx: The index the clicked item was on in each of the 20 presented slates.\n",
    "- slate_lengths: The length of the 20 presented slates.\n",
    "- slate: All the items in each of the 20 presented slates.\n",
    "- interaction_type: The recommendation slate can be the result of a search query (1), a recommendation (2) or can be undefined (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset `itemattr.npz` contains the categories ranging from 0 to 290. Corresponding with the 290 unique groups that the items belong to. These 290 unique groups are constructed using a combination of categorical information and the geographical location. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset  `ind2val.json` contains the mapping between the indices and the values of the categories (e.g. `\"287\": \"JOB, Rogaland\"`) and interaction types (e.g. `\"1\": \"search\"`).                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

    "This repository is currently *work in progress*, and we will provide descriptions and tutorials. Suggestions and contributions to make the material more available are welcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "- [ ] Add more usable functions that compute relevant metrics such as F1, counterfactual metrics etc.\n",
    "- [ ] The git lfs is currently broken by removing some lines in .gitattributes that is in conflict with nbdev. The dataset is still usable using the building download functions as they use a different source. However, we should fix this. An issue is [posted on nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/issues/506)."
